def convert_to_catalyst_jaxpr(closed_jaxpr, args):
    """
    This function converts a Qrisp Jaxpr to the equivalent in Catalyst.
    
    The Qrisp and the Catalyst Jaxpr are differing in the way how they treat 
    quantum gates (that are fundamentally in-place) in the functional programming
    setting, where in-place operations are forbidden.
    
    The Catalyst Jaxpr creates new qubit objects for every quantum gate and returns these.
    Furthermore the qinsert primitive creates a new register object, representing the new
    register with the inserted qubit.
    
    The Qrisp Jaxpr treats qubit and registers as opaque objects that could however be
    represented by simple integers indexing qubits in a quantum circuit.
    Quantum gates are modelled as functions that take a quantum circuit and qubit object 
    (aka. tensor indices) and return a new quantum circuit object.
    
    This has the nice property that measurements are side effect free operations,
    which is not the case for the Catalyst model, since the induced collaps can 
    influence non-participating qubit objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    closed_jaxpr : Jaxpr
        A Jaxpr coming from a traced Qrisp function.
    args : iterable
        The arguments for the Qrisp function.

    Returns
    -------
    Jaxpr
        A Jaxpr using Catalyst primitives.
